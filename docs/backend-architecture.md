# Backend Architecture

## 1. Frontend (Next.js)
Next.js remains the same, handling the presentation layer and user interactions.

## 2. Backend (C#)
Use C# with a framework like ASP.NET Core to build both the backend and API service.
ASP.NET Core provides robust features for building RESTful APIs, making it suitable for serving data to your Next.js frontend.
Implement controllers and actions to handle various API endpoints for user authentication, product management, cart management, checkout process, etc.

## 3. Database (MongoDB)
MongoDB remains the same, storing data related to products, users, orders, etc.
Design MongoDB collections to efficiently store and retrieve data for your e-commerce application.

## 4. Headless CMS Integration (Contentful)
Contentful integration also remains the same, managing and delivering content for static pages, blog posts, product descriptions, etc.
Integrate Contentful's APIs into your C# backend to fetch dynamic content and associate it with your e-commerce products and pages.

## 5. Authentication and Authorization
Implement user authentication using JWT or other authentication mechanisms within your C# backend.
Ensure secure authentication and authorization for user accounts, admin roles, and protected API endpoints.

## 6. Business Logic
Handle business logic such as product inventory management, order processing, payment gateway integration, etc., within your C# backend.
Implement validation and error handling to ensure data consistency and reliability.

## 7. Middleware and Services
Utilize middleware for request processing, logging, error handling, etc., in your C# backend.
Develop services for modularizing your backend codebase, facilitating scalability, and code maintainability.

## 8. External Services Integration
Integrate with external services such as payment gateways, shipping providers, analytics platforms, etc., to enhance the functionality of your e-commerce application.

## 9. Deployment and Scalability
Deploy your C# backend and API service on a cloud platform like Azure, AWS, or Google Cloud Platform for scalability, reliability, and performance.
Utilize containerization (e.g., Docker) and orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) for efficient deployment and scaling of your backend services.
