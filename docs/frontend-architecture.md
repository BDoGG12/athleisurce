# Frontend Architecture Documentation

## 1. Next.js Framework
Next.js will serve as the foundation for your frontend. It provides server-side rendering, client-side routing, and many other features out of the box.

## 2. UI Components
Break down your UI into reusable components. These can include product cards, navigation bars, shopping carts, etc. Consider using libraries like Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind CSS for styling and component design.

## 3. API Routes
Next.js allows you to create API routes within your application. These routes can handle backend requests and interact with your C# backend server and MongoDB database. You can use these routes for tasks like fetching product data, processing orders, etc.

## 4. Contentful Integration
Since you're using Contentful as your headless CMS, integrate it into your frontend to manage content such as product descriptions, blog posts, etc. Contentful provides a Content Delivery API (CDA) for retrieving content, which you can call from your Next.js application.

## 5. State Management
Manage application state using tools like React Context API or libraries such as Redux or MobX. This will help manage data like user authentication state, shopping cart contents, etc.

## 6. Authentication
Implement user authentication and authorization mechanisms. You can use libraries like NextAuth.js for authentication, and JWT tokens or session cookies for authorization.

## 7. GraphQL Integration (Optional)
Consider using GraphQL for querying data from your backend and Contentful. Tools like Apollo Client can help you integrate GraphQL seamlessly into your Next.js application.

## 8. Styling and Theming
Implement consistent styling and theming throughout your application using CSS, Sass, or styled-components. This ensures a cohesive user experience.

## 9. Optimization and Performance
Ensure your application is optimized for performance. Utilize Next.js features like automatic code splitting, image optimization, and server-side rendering to improve loading times.

## 10. Testing and Deployment
Write unit tests for critical components and integration tests for API routes. Deploy your application using platforms like Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify for seamless deployment and scaling.
